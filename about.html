    <h1>Colorism In The Media</h1>
    <p> Like most of us, consuming media has quickly become apart of our everyday lives. Whether it's instagram, tiktok, netflix the options are endless and colorism unfortunatley, runs rampant throughout these spaces. </p>

    <p> For Instance, I am unaware of how many of you are familiar with the film called <a href="the_hate_you_give.html">The Hate You Give</a> but it was a film that was released in 2018<, that originated from the Novel by Angie Thomas which follows the issues of police brutality and racisim. As impoortant as the film was and the relevance of the topics being discusses it received a bunch of backlash for one particular reason. The main character of the novel Starr Carter is a teenage girl as we follow her varying lives at a predominantly white private high school vs her predominantly black neighborhood. In the books Angie Thomas describes star as a darkskin  black girl with coily curly hair. So you can understand the confusion for highly anticipated fans, when a lightskin mixed woman with looser curls played by Amandla Sternberg was casted. And when the conversation of why she was chosen was brought to the forefront, it was met with comments saying that she was more "marketable" </p>
    <p>The reason why this situation is incredily harmful is for a multitude of reasons. The first being that black woman being shown and highlighted as main characters, especially in TV and media is incredibly uncommon. It's even more uncommnon for darkskin women to be cast as the leading lady, so the fact that a novel was written around and developed around a darkskin fully black character contributes to the erasure of black stories and their importance in Western Media.</p>
